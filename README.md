# Challenges I ran into
One major challenge was deploying the project because I had no experience in doing so. I needed to fix build issues, remove unecessary code, and tweak the configuration commands.

Another challenge was handling the user login. Initially, I wanted to use an Express.js framework to handle user login, and connect that to a SQLite database, but it turned out to be much more complicated than I expected. As a result, I stuck to the MVP of building a simple Plinko Balls game.
